        "star": "If you ever feel tired or need to stay safe in the water, you can float like a starfish to stay above the surface. First, stay calm and take a deep breath, as relaxing helps you float better. Then, slowly lie on your back, keeping your face up toward the sky. Spread your arms and legs wide like a starfish to help your body stay balanced on the water. Breathe slowly and stay as still as possible, allowing the water to support you. Practicing in shallow water with an adult nearby will help you feel more confident. This simple floating trick can help you rest and stay safe until help arrives.",
        "freestyle": "Teaching freestyle swimming starts with body position, ensuring the swimmer stays horizontal and streamlined in the water. Next, they learn proper kicking, using a steady flutter kick from the hips while keeping legs relaxed. Arm movements follow, with alternating strokes that enter the water smoothly and pull back in a controlled motion. Breathing is crucial, so they practice turning their head to the side to inhale without disrupting their rhythm. Coordination of arms, legs, and breathing is then refined through drills and repetition. Finally, continuous practice builds endurance and confidence, helping swimmers move efficiently through the water.",
        "backstroke": "Teaching backstroke swimming begins with helping swimmers feel comfortable floating on their backs. We start by practicing a steady flutter kick, ensuring the legs stay straight and move from the hips. Next, we introduce arm movements, teaching swimmers to lift one arm at a time, extend it overhead, and pull the water back in a circular motion. Proper breathing is emphasized, as the face stays above water, allowing for natural and relaxed breaths. Coordination between kicking and arm strokes is key, so we encourage slow, rhythmic movements before increasing speed. With practice and guidance, swimmers develop confidence and improve their backstroke technique.",
        "breaststroke": "Teaching breaststroke starts with a flat, streamlined body position. Swimmers learn the frog-like kick by bending their knees, pushing their feet outward, and gliding. Arm movements involve extending forward, sweeping outward, and bringing the hands together. Breathing is synchronized by inhaling as the head lifts and exhaling while gliding. Smooth coordination of arms, legs, and breathing is essential for efficiency. With practice, swimmers develop a strong and controlled breaststroke technique.",
        "butterfly": "Teaching butterfly swimming starts with learning the dolphin kick, where the legs move together in a wave-like motion from the hips. Swimmers then practice the arm movement, bringing both arms forward together and pulling the water back in a circular motion. Timing and coordination are key, so we teach them to kick once when their arms enter the water and again when they pull back. Proper breathing is taught by lifting the head forward during the arm recovery. We start with drills like single-arm strokes and underwater kicks before practicing the full stroke. With patience and practice, swimmers build strength and master the butterfly technique."
